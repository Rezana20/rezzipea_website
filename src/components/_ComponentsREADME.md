### What do we want to keep in this folder?
This folder contains all reusable components that are used throughout the app. Components that are not reusable should live within their respective pages. 
Once a component becomes reusable we can move it here. 

### What is the naming convention?
AppComponentName - where component name describes the component

### What structure should the files be mostly in?
1. Each component should have an interface with the desired props 
2. Each component should declare a function AppComponentName(AppComponentProps)
3. Each component should have a final export default AppComponentName
